Hi, my name is David Newham and I study Computer Science at Sheffield Hallam. Welcome to my small blog where I post things that I find intresting.

My primary workmachine is a Thinkpad X220, with an upgraded IPS panel. Running Debian Jessie 8.4, Kernel 4.5.0


Theme for the blog can be found here by the taleneted <a href="https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon"><b>Taylantatli</b></a>
